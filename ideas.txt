this will pretty much store all of the ideas that i have for the text adventure
some tasks that i need to set up the whole thing are as follows:


1. find out how to get git working on linux,
   and if there is a need?? (SUBVERSION SYSTEMS)
2. how do events work in python/programming??
3. how to make modules...??

first of all, there needs to be a couple of tasks...
CLASSES:
    PLAYER
        --> HEALTH
        --> MONEY
    
    INVENTORY
        --> basically a big list
        --> a couple of functions, like gain
            or loss of items
        --> can contain OBJECTS/ITEMS
    
    ITEMS
        --> can have certain attributes

    LOCATION
        --> contains ROOMS
        --> grid-like system?? I don't know how this will be implemented...
    
    ROOMS
        --> has a LOCATION
        --> has DOORS
        --> I dunno
        --> wtf to do...
    
    INTERPRETER
        --> basically the prompt
        --> takes in commands and scans stuff
        --> to make the PLAYER move and such
