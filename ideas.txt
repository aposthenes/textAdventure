this will pretty much store all of the ideas that i have for the text adventure
some tasks that i need to set up the whole thing are as follows:


1. find out how to get git working on linux,
   and if there is a need?? (SUBVERSION SYSTEMS)
2. how do events work in python/programming??
3. how to make modules...??

TODO:
    1) "you can't move that way"... prints at the TOP of the game description/gameplay.
        the parser should handle all of the printing, so move stuff from TEST.PY to PARSER.PY
        also because if you tried to make player's move() print each time stuff happens,
        all of the print MAP and print ROOMDESCRIPTION is in the variable named roomsList
        in TEST.PY. These programs are really sticking across each other really quickly.
    2) my next task is the ITEMS stuff. Letting the user hold a weapon.
    3) interchangeable with the INVENTORY system
    4) after that, my PARSER.
    5) the program isn't massive at all, and it's only one person writing all of this...
        but at the same time it would be really nice if we could get a COMMENT SYSTEM
        going on.
    6) why am I writing in ALL CAPS? Note that in the future I want all significant items that
        you can look at to be either colored or IN ALL CAPS or BOTH.

first of all, there needs to be a couple of tasks...
CLASSES:
    PLAYER
        --> HEALTH
        --> MONEY
    
    INVENTORY
        --> basically a big list
        --> a couple of functions, like gain
            or loss of items
        --> can contain OBJECTS/ITEMS
    
    ITEMS
        --> can have certain attributes

    LOCATION
        --> contains ROOMS
        --> grid-like system?? I don't know how this will be implemented...
    
    ROOMS
        --> has a LOCATION
        --> has DOORS
        --> I dunno
        --> wtf to do...
    
    INTERPRETER
        --> basically the prompt
        --> takes in commands and scans stuff
        --> to make the PLAYER move and such
